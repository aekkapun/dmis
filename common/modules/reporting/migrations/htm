The extension has been generated successfully.

To enable it in your application, you need to create a git repository and require it via composer.


cd /var/www/html/girc/dmis/frontend/runtime/tmp-extensions/yii2-reporting

git init
git add -A
git commit
git remote add origin https://path.to/your/repo
git push -u origin master

The next step is just for initial development, skip it if you directly publish the extension on packagist.org

Add the newly created repo to your composer.json.


"repositories":[
    {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://path.to/your/repo"
    }
]

Note: You may use the url file:///var/www/html/girc/dmis/frontend/runtime/tmp-extensions/yii2-reporting for testing.

Require the package with composer


composer.phar require ramshresh/yii2-reporting:dev-master

And use it in your application.


\ramshresh\reporting\AutoloadExample::widget();
